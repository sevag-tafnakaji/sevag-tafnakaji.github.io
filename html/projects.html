                    My first large project was my bachelor thesis. The main objective was
                    the implementation of a mobile manipulator for general pick and place tasks.
                    This means that we expect to have a camera view of the area/room, and a map of
                    the area before we try to execute any tasks. Using these informations, 
                    the robot should be able to estimate where the desired object is, navigate towards it,
                    then attempt to lift it up and transport it to another desired position.

                        As there were technical issues with the mobile base, the navigation implementations could 
                        only be tested in the simulations. This meant that the build in navigation implementations 
                        and tools could not be taken advantage of so we had to assume no available resources other than 
                        the sensors on the robot. We had simulated the navigation using the two laser scanners on the robot, 
                        following the popular ROS navigation stack implementations we had global planners, local planners, localisation
                        methods and mapping capabilities. We did some quick tests on the mobile manipulator's capabilities of object
                        avoidance using different popular ROS local planners and found that Timed Elastic Band (TEB) was better than Dynamic
                        Window Approach (DWB) which matched some other works on the same algorithms. Currently, the mobile base is being fixed which means that
                        a future project is to implement said navigation on the robot and see if it works as well as it does in the simulation
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftText">
                    Most of our work was done in simulations, using the ROS framework. We used python and
                    readily available ROS packages to implement the needed parts for the project. for the CV,
                    we used the PCL library which did the segmentation and filtration needed to isolate the object
                    the robot was to grab (which in this video is the milk bottle). The visualisation in the RVIZ window
                    shows already the filtered input from the depth camera found in the room. Once the segmentation was done,
                    the GPD library was used to find suitable grasps which we tuned to the available gripper. Due to some limitations,
                    however, we were never able to place the object somewhere else. We found that in the simulation, the physics engine
                    had difficulties simulating contact between the gripper and the object and that lead to the object flying out of view,
                    and due to the base in the real world not working, we could not transport it somewhere else. Later we could move things around
                    on the same table which made it behave like a regular, stationary, manipulator.
